I want Durable Objects to become a globally replicated storage system with the ability to relocate its write-leader geographically closer to users.

<div className="border-t w-32" />

That's a mouthful, so let me digest. 
[Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) are an amazing compute 
primitive offered by [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) based on the 
[Actor programming model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model). It's easy to think of them as
[mini virtual machines, all addressable, with zero startup time](https://x.com/threepointone/status/1888543177910403333). 
In September of 2024 when Cloudflare added [SQLite support](https://blog.cloudflare.com/sqlite-in-durable-objects/)
they became even more powerful, but there is one last feature that I wish they had: __global replication__.

At the time of writing, when a request is made to a Durable Object for the very first time it is instantiated in a
data center _close_ to where the initial request was made (usually within 50ms). 

We make use of them heavily at [univo](https://univo.app), especially with our
[dashboard application](https://univo.app/login).
